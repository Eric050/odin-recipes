<h3>Recipe steps</h3>

    <li>Blend the chunks with bamboo shoots and seasoning</li>
    <li>Place prawn paste into a mixing bowl and mix with prawn chunks</li>
    <li>Cover the mixture and place in the refrigerator</li>
    <li>In a medium-sized bowl, mix the wheat starch, tapioca starch and salt together with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Then, add the oil and BOILING hot water.</li>
    <li>Very quickly, mix the dough mixture. It should solidify and turn into a rough dough</li>
    <li>take one piece of dumpling dough, roll it into a round sphere with the palm of your hands then place and press the dough onto the work surface into a disk. Then, roll the dough into a round translucent skin or sheet, turning regularly to keep it evenly round.</li>
